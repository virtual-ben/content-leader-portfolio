### The challenge
The Information Development department at McAfee has 28 writers trying to provide product documentation for 40+ products, tools, and ultilities. That ratio isn't changing anytime soon. We needed to focus our efforts on critical documentation efforts, and let the rest go. I recruited our full-time editor and a small cadre of interested writers to develop a strategy that could guide the department's decision-making. 

This content strategy team was tasked with answering these questions:

- What content should we be producing?
- Is the content we produce any good? 
- What can we say "no" to?
